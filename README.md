# 📂 DocuMind – AI-Powered Document Intelligence Platform

DocuMind is an **AI-powered platform** that lets you upload documents, extract knowledge, and ask natural language questions to retrieve answers instantly.  

It implements an end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, embeddings, and vector databases — combined with a modern **Streamlit** frontend and **AWS ECS cloud deployment** with CI/CD.

This project demonstrates practical skills in **AI**, **full-stack development**, and **MLOps** — making it a strong portfolio project for internships and jobs.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Organizations and individuals deal with massive volumes of unstructured data (PDFs, Word files, notes).  
Traditional keyword-based search often fails to capture context and semantic meaning, making it difficult to find the right information quickly.  

**DocuMind solves this by:**
- 📂 Extracting and chunking document content automatically  
- 🔍 Generating **semantic embeddings** to represent knowledge  
- ⚡ Storing data in **vector databases** for efficient retrieval  
- 🤖 Using **LLMs** to answer queries in natural language with context-aware responses
